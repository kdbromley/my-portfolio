              <p> I'm a Engineering Flex Student at Thinkful and an emerging web developer.</p>
              <p>I'm currently based in Los Angeles, having just moved here in August from Denver.</p>
              <p>My background is in Neuroscience and Writing, so I like to think I have an edge of creativity with critical thinking skills to match, and that I see the world for its endless opportunities for creation and discovery. The career opportunities for these fields, however, didn't really vibe with my work style and personal goals, which is what led me to web development. I'm now in the midst of my journey towards becoming a web developer and looking forward to a career that's dynamic, rewarding, and purposeful, all while nourishing to my constant desire for growth and learning.</p>

          <div class="group-column">
            <div class="item">
              <p>I'm drawn to web development because I love to mix creativity with utility. I get a sincere sense of gratification from seeing my work have a tangible outcome and effect. Even better, if that work is attractive, appealing, that it's a positive experience for others. I notice when website and apps are aesthetically pleasing, functional, intuitive, and intelligent - they're enjoyable to use! I'm excited to one day be on the other end, creating those experiences for other users, especially as the world moves increasingly online.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p>I also know that none of these websites or apps were the work of a singular person. Creativity flourishes in collaboration. My background in Neuroscience and Writing gave me plenty of experience in teamwork and cooperation: no piece of writing was done before getting feedback and input from other writers, constant critique and revision and critique; experimental proposals were created by teams of researchers and vetted, shredded, critiqued, rewritten multiple times before moving forward. I look forward to working on a team again, sharing inspiration and honing ideas and bringing unique skills and styles together to create attractive and functional projects.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
              <p>I'm still new to web development (month 2 of 6 with Thinkful!), but I do know the fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML5/CSS3. This little website is testament to the skills I've learned thus far--and will continue to grow with me. If you're looking to take on an intern, I'd love to <a> hear from you </a>. I can offer a creative perspective and exceptional dedication, and I'm notably skilled at and comfortable with self-direction and working with ambiguity; in turn, real-word experience with web development would be invaluable to me. I'm particularly passionate about web accessibility, so teams that prioritize accessibility and pursue expansion of accessibility would be a great fit for me!</p>

            <p>Outside of coding, I'm always seeking new knowledge and experiences. I'm constantly learning about philosophy, politics, linguistics, and music through podcasts and books. I'm a writer and reader (or was, when I had "free time").  I'm learning to speak German, currently at B2.2 level. I'm always finding new music--experimental electronic/techno, minimal synth, and art rock are my current niches. I'll also categorize coffee-drinking as a hobby. And when I get a chance, I like to camp and hike. </p>
