        <div class="bio-text-box">
          <p>I'm a student in the Engineering Flex course at Thinkful and a up-and-coming web developer.</p>
          <p>Coming from a background in Neuroscience and Writing, I'm now applying my critical thinking skills and creativity towards a career in web development!<br>
          I'm currently living in Los Angeles, California. </p>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm still new to the world of web development, but I'm thrilled to be on this journey. I'm particularly excited about:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>A future full of learning - I enjoy constant learning and discovery.</li>
              <li>A career with tangible results - I want my work to have purpose and real-world effects.</li>
              <li>A community of curious people - I love to connect and engage with other people about shared interests, and I'm excited to share ideas, inspirations, discoveries, and successes with other developers.</li>
            </ol>

          <p>Outside of learning to code, I work as a barista, pretend I still have time to read books, shoot film photography, listen to experimental music, and go camping.</p>
