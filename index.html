          <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm still new to the world of web development, but I'm thrilled to be on this journey. I'm particularly excited about:</p>
            <ol>                              <!-- ordered list, styled with numbers inside container and space between list items -->
              <li>A future full of learning - I enjoy constant learning and discovery.</li>
              <li>A career with tangible results - I want my work to have purpose and real-world effects.</li>
              <li>A community of curious people - I love to connect and engage with other people about shared interests, and I'm excited to share ideas, inspirations, discoveries, and successes with other developers.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Outside of learning to code, I work as a barista, pretend I still have time to read books, shoot film photography, listen to experimental music, and go camping.</p>
