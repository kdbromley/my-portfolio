## Technical Requirements
Main focus for this update is:
-Create a page layout using flexbox
-Implement appropriate media queries for responsive design.
-Build without use of templates (from scratch)

## Some context :
I completely redid the website layout for this assignment, both for practice and for ease, as the last webpage I built was so basic that completely rebuilding was easier than trying to navigate the code to completely rearrange the layout as well as reorganize stylesheet. This feels like it's got good bones, so I intend to continue updating this website as I gain more tools and skills!
